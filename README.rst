====================
TTSLab Bambara Build
====================

This repository contains resources, configuration files and scripts to
build a simple slot-and-filler TTS system for Bambara.

This work was done as part of the EU VOICES project
(http://www.mvoices.eu/) and the deployed system can be found at
http://projects.emerginov.org/voices_snftts/

Please refer to the file ``HOWTO.rst`` in this directory for how to
setup the required software in order to build the system from this
resource.
